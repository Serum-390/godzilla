= Overview

[[overview_http_verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

Godzilla ERP tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST
conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview_http_status_codes]]
== HTTP status codes

Godzilla ERP tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST
conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available
from the response's `Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `302 Found`
| Indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL
given by the Location header

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing
further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview_errors]]
== Errors

In version {current-version}, Godzilla ERP is not enforcing a specific error
response format. Errors will be reported with status codes >= 400. A specific
error response format is planned for a future release of Godzilla ERP.

=== Status Codes
++++
<table style="font-weight: bold; max-width: fit-content; border: 0px;">
  <tr>
    <td style="color: green; text-align: right;">GOOD: </td>
    <td> < 400</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="background-color: transparent;">
    <td style="color: red; text-align: right;"> BAD: </td>
    <td> >= 400 </td>
  </tr>
</table>
++++


// !!! BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE ERROR DOC SHOULD IDEALLY LOOK LIKE
// Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will
// contain a JSON object that describes the problem. The error object has the
// following structure:

// include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

// For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a note will produce a
// `400 Bad Request` response:

// include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview_hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

Hypermedia is an important part of a mature RESTful API. Version
{current-version} of the Godzilla ERP Rest APIs does not support hypermedia,
though the project _is_ using the appropriate HTTP verbs for each of their
respective semantics (e.g.: `GET` for obtaining data about a resource, `POST`
for adding to a resource, etc.)

In terms of the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model[Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)],
our current APIs would be *LEVEL 2*: HTTP verbs, but no hypermedia. Hypermedia
support (*LEVEL 3* REST APIs) will be coming up in a future release of Godzilla
ERP.

// Godzilla ERP uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in
// their responses. Responses are in
// https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext Application Language
// (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API
// should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described
// links to navigate from resource to resource.

[[resources_login]]
== Login

Godzilla ERP v{current-version} implements HTTP basic authentication with a very
simple login page that looks like:

image::/api/docs/login-page.png[Login Page, width=30%, align="center"]

Upon login, this page will return an authentication token in the form of a
session cookie.

=== Logging In - `POST /login`

Authenticates with Godzilla ERP using HTTP basic.

// ??? The raw request and response are included to obscure the demo username //
// ??? and passwords used in testing. (though these are included in plaintext in
// ??? the project repository)
